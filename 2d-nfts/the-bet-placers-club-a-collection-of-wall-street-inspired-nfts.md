# THE BET PLACER’S CLUB: A COLLECTION OF WALL STREET INSPIRED NFTs

### The Bet Placer's Club mission

Bet Placer’s Club is an exciting initiative of Dutch Art Collections. Together, we assembled a team that places their bets with 100% certainty on the future value of the upcoming Metaverse world. As we see a rising demand for high quality gaming experiences, we are convinced that 3D user experience games are the right direction. In the future, we might also explore further establishment of Augmented and Virtual Reality applicability

With the help of our loyal community, we are reinvesting sales in the development of a new 3D world for Bet Placer’s Club holders. The utility of those Bet Placers will be primarily created through a ‘Play to Earn’ concept. At the moment, our priority is to raise awareness of the Bet Placer’s Club community, which consists of long-term investors, NFT-flippers, gamers, traders, yield-farmers and blockchain enthusiasts. By allowing you to buy with traditional Fiat, we open up the Metaverse to everyone!

### The story of the Bet Placer's Club

The inspiration for the Bet Placer’s character came from the legendary short squeeze of the GameStop stocks (GME). The Bet Placer’s love their risks to be as high as their rewards and are not afraid of the big hedge funds betting against them. The community vouches for each other and with the smallest investments they will be able to shake up the entire world. Are you ready to cause a revolution in the Metaverse? The Bet Placer’s Club is looking for you!

### The Bet Placer’s 2D & 3D collections

The first collection consists of 10.000 unique 2D Bet Placer’s Club NFTs. Every single NFT of this collection is a unique collectible. Each layer is handmade and sent as a high quality vector based SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. Unlike raster files, vector graphics always maintain their resolution, no matter how much they’re scaled up or down. For that reason, every collectible of the Bet Placer’s Club can be printed in any size you want. Imagine printing your NFTs on T-shirts, coffee mugs or even billboards - it’s all possible!Later this year, we will release another collection: 20.000 unique 3D Avatar NFTs. Are you a holder of the first 2D Genesis NFT collection? If so, you will get a free 3D avatar NFT AirDropped to your wallet. The 3D NFT collection has similar traits as the 2D NFT you already own, so that the rarity is preserved for each holder. The avatars will be compatible with the NetVRK Metaverse, which will go live at the end of 2022.
