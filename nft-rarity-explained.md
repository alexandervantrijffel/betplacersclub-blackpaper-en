# NFT Rarity explained

Our NFTs consist of 12 layers and are designed with Wall Street in mind. Our artist Harmstar created 309 unique traits for the 2D Genesis Bet Placer’s Club collection. Each NFT is algorithmically generated from these traits and has a different rarity. We developed our own highly complicated Art Generator in which certain combined Traits result in extra rare Theme Characters. Each NFT has its own unique Metadata viewable on Opensea. io to check your rarity rank. On top of that, the Golden and Diamond tier will have a special Bet Placer’s Club Badge in such your choice of Tier is written as a piece of history on the Ethereum Blockchain. Please find our complete rarity table on the right.
